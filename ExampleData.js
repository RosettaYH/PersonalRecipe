Twice-Baked Potatoes,"8 baking potatoes, washed;

1 cup whole milk;
2 teaspoons seasoned salt;
3 green onions, sliced;
Freshly ground black pepper;","Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.;
Place the potatoes on a baking sheet. Rub them with the canola oil and bake for 1 hour, making sure they're sufficiently cooked through.;
Slice the butter into pats. Place in a large mixing bowl and add the bacon bits and sour cream. Remove the potatoes from the oven. Lower the heat to 350 degrees F.;

Smash the potatoes into the butter, bacon and sour cream. Add the cheese, milk, seasoned salt, green onions and black pepper to taste and mix together well. (IMPORTANT: If you plan to freeze the twice-baked potatoes, do NOT add the green onions.);
Fill the potato shells with the filling. I like to fill the shells so they look abundant and heaping.
